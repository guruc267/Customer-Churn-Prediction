# Customer-Churn-Prediction
To analyze customer behavior and build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) or stay, allowing businesses to take proactive retention measures.

# ðŸ§  Problem Statement:
Customer retention is a major challenge for subscription-based services. Losing existing customers leads to lost revenue and higher acquisition costs. By predicting which customers are at risk of churning, businesses can take actions to retain them.

# ðŸ§¾ Dataset:
You can use a publicly available dataset like:

Telco Customer Churn Dataset 

## ðŸ§ª Steps in the Project:
1. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing or inconsistent data

Convert categorical variables using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding

Feature scaling for numerical variables

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Churn rate distribution

Correlation between features

Visuals: Bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, box plots

Insights: What characteristics do churned customers share?

# 3. Feature Engineering:
Derive features like AvgMonthlySpend = TotalCharges / Tenure

Combine multiple binary service features

Encode tenure into categorical bins (e.g., New, Medium, Loyal)

# 4. Model Building:
Train several models and compare performance:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

SVM

Neural Networks (optional)

# 5. Model Evaluation:
Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

ROC-AUC Curve

Cross-validation

# 6. Interpretability:
Feature Importance (SHAP, LIME, or built-in tools)

Which factors contribute most to churn?

# 7. Deployment (Optional):
Build a Streamlit or Flask web app

Input customer data â†’ Output churn probability

Include visual explanations

ðŸ“ˆ Expected Results & Insights:
Identify top reasons for customer churn

Create churn risk segments

Recommend retention strategies (e.g., offer discounts to high-risk users)

Accuracy / ROC-AUC > 85% for a good model


# ðŸ”§ Tools and Tech Stack:
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP

Optional: Streamlit/Flask, Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
